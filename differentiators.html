                <h2>Beyond the Hype: What Real Uptime Looks Like</h2>
                <p>When you choose hosting, you’re choosing the foundation your business runs on. Most providers offer standard VPS configurations where your service lives on a single physical machine. If that machine has a network card failure, power issue, or disk fault, your service goes down until it's manually restored.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SavvyFront is built on a different philosophy: Redundancy as default.</strong></p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Feature</th>
                            <th>Standard Hosting (Single Server)</th>

                            <td>High. One failing drive or PSU means downtime.</td>
                            <td>Low. Services instantly migrate to healthy nodes.</td>

                            <td>Can suffer during hardware maintenance or neighbor issues.</td>
                            <td>Consistent high performance due to workload balancing across the cluster.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Upgrade Path</strong></td>
                            <td>Requires planned maintenance window and migration downtime.</td>
                            <td>Seamless live migration. We can upgrade hardware components without you ever noticing.</td>
