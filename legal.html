                <h2>Legal Framework & Compliance</h2>
                
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The documents below are structural outlines for planning purposes only. They must be reviewed and finalized by a qualified legal professional to ensure compliance with all relevant laws (especially GDPR/UK laws, given your location and travel).</p>

                <!-- TOS Outline -->
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Terms of Service (TOS) Outline</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Introduction & Acceptance:</strong> Agreement to these terms.
    *   Definition of Services (VPS Hosting on Proxmox/Ceph).
    *   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <em>Crucial section for what users cannot do (e.g., spam, illegal activity, high resource abuse).</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Service Provision & Uptime:</strong>
    *   Description of the clustered architecture (mentioning Proxmox/Ceph briefly as the basis for reliability).
    *   Uptime Guarantee/SLA (Referencing the Blesta configuration).

                    <li><strong>Billing, Payments, and Cancellations:</strong>

    *   Customer Responsibility: User retains full responsibility for their data content and configuration.
